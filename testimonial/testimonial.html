Badal has this amazing talent for turning my ideas into awesome designs. They just get what I'm thinking, and the designs they came up with were often so good that we didn't need to make many changes even in the first draft!
Even when we did need a few tweaks, Badal was super cool about it. They were open to making things better and added some really cool touches. Working with them was easy, and I'm really happy with how our website looks now.
I totally recommend Badal for their talent and how easy they are to work with. They made our website look awesome!
